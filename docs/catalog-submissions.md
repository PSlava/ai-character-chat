## Long Description

SweetSin is a free AI character chat platform for immersive roleplay and fantasy conversations. Chat with AI-powered characters using 9 different AI providers including Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, and more. Create custom characters with detailed personalities, appearances, and scenarios — or explore a growing catalog of ready-made characters.

Features include group chats with multiple AI characters, lorebooks for world-building, automatic chat memory with summarization, SillyTavern card import/export, and full multi-language support (English, Spanish, Russian, French, German, Portuguese, Italian).

All responses use a literary prose format with third-person narration, show-don't-tell writing, and natural dialogue — no typical AI-sounding output.
